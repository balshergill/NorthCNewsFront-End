This is a news Web application serving as the frontend to the NCNews API hosted at https://balsnewsnc.herokuapp.com/api/

The application allows you to post articles to new or existing topics as well as comment and vote on the articles.

Starting
You need node.js (at least v11.0.0) and npm (at least version 6.4.1) and VS code or another text editor

Get the code
Fork the project from git. Copy the git url and when in the appropriate folder on your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/balshergill/newsNCFront-End/
This creates the project locally. Open the project in your text editor

## Install Dependencies
Run the following to install all the required packages.

### `npm install`
Once all required dependencies are installed, you can check the node_modules folder (which should be created now) to see if the folders for each of these libraries exists.

To run the app use:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
